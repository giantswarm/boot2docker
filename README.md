This guide will walk you through installing **boot2docker**, **virtualbox**, and **docker** on your Mac/OSX based machine.

### Prerequisites

You need an OSX based machine and the will to type things on the command line.  Also, the following won't hurt:

* VirtualBox
* Brew
* Docker

I'm not going to link to these here because we'll cover installing them below.


### Video Walkthrough

Here's another video where I type a bit and talk a bit. I like the angle from the laptop!
